## Project overview

CoolerGuru Admin is the standalone extraction of the existing CoolerGuru admin portal, built with Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, and shadcn/ui. Preserve its existing UI and backend integration.

Production: https://admin.coolerguru.com. Local: http://localhost:3001.
Overview is `/`; login is `/login`. Every auth request uses ADMIN.
Backend `/admin` endpoints and `/api/admin-backend` keep their paths.
Register and add-admin require an authenticated ADMIN role. Preserve cookie rotation,
proxy forwarding, and server checks. The original `../coolerguru-frontend` is read-only.
Never display environment values. See README.md and MIGRATION.md for deployment and validation.

This repository uses the shadcn `radix-nova` style. The shadcn CLI reports `base: "radix"`, which refers to Radix UI. Always inspect the local components in `src/components/ui/` because individual wrappers may use different primitives.

# Next.js: ALWAYS read docs before coding

Before any Next.js work, find and read the relevant doc in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`. Your training data is outdated — the docs are the source of truth.

## shadcn skill

Use the shadcn skill for all work involving shadcn/ui components, styling, composition, registries, presets, or `components.json`.

If the skill is not available, install it with:

```bash
npx skills add shadcn/ui
```

The skill contains the component, styling, composition, accessibility, and CLI rules. Do not duplicate those rules here. Always inspect the local component source before using it.

Do not modify files inside `src/components/ui/` or `src/components/calendar/`. Keep these components intact and apply styling or customization where they are used.

## Setup

This project uses npm.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Available commands:

```bash
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run check
node scripts/verify-migration.cjs
```

`lint` uses the existing Next.js ESLint configuration; `check` runs TypeScript. Migration verification mocks the backend. Run validation only when the user explicitly requests it.

## Co-location-based structure

Keep feature code close to the route that owns it.

- Dashboard routes: `src/app/(dashboard)/<screen>/page.tsx`
- Auth routes: `src/app/(auth)/<screen>/page.tsx`
- Existing feature components: `src/components/admin/<screen>/`
- New screen-specific components: the owning route's `_components/` directory
- Shared dashboard components: `src/components/dashboard/`
- Shared application components: `src/components/`
- Local shadcn components: `src/components/ui/`
- Shared hooks and utilities: `src/hooks/` and `src/lib/`
- Theme presets: `src/styles/presets/`

Keep a component inside its route until it is reused by another feature. Do not move screen-specific code into a shared directory preemptively.

## Creating or extending a screen

1. Inspect the existing CoolerGuru screen before writing code. Preserve its appearance and behavior during extraction work.
2. When reproducing a UI from a screenshot or image, follow its visual direction closely, including layout, hierarchy, spacing, component structure, and important details. Implement it with the project's existing components and semantic theme tokens rather than copying raw color values. If the design needs a color that is not available through the existing theme tokens, or the user explicitly requests a non-theme color, use a named color from Tailwind's default palette. Do not use arbitrary hex, RGB, HSL, or OKLCH values.
3. Reuse the existing dashboard shell, local components, layout controls, and theme tokens.
4. Break each new page into focused components inside the route's `_components/` directory. Keep `page.tsx` small and focused on composing those pieces.
5. Keep `page.tsx` as a Server Component by default. Move interactive or browser-dependent code into a dedicated Client Component.
6. Add the screen to `src/navigation/dashboard/admin-navigation.ts` when it should appear in the dashboard navigation.
7. Decide the information hierarchy before choosing widgets. Let the content determine the page structure.
8. Keep the established visual rhythm where it fits: compact spacing, clear typography hierarchy, responsive action rows, and grids that collapse cleanly on smaller screens.
9. Widget selection is not a fixed formula. Try different arrangements of cards, resource rows, meters, charts, tabs, empty states, and actions, then keep the version that communicates the content clearly and feels consistent with the project.
10. Match nearby screens in card density, borders, radius, spacing, content width, and responsive behavior.
11. Use semantic theme tokens so new screens work with light mode, dark mode, and the existing theme presets.
12. Handle relevant loading, empty, error, disabled, and overflow states.
13. Keep screens accessible with semantic HTML, keyboard support, visible focus states, labels, and appropriate ARIA attributes.

## Code conventions

- TypeScript strict mode is enabled. Use precise types and avoid `any`.
- Use the existing `@/` import aliases.
- Follow the Biome configuration: double quotes, semicolons, two-space indentation, sorted imports, and a 120-character line width.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies.
- Keep changes focused and do not refactor unrelated files.

## Contributions

- Use conventional commit prefixes such as `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, and `chore:`.
- Include screenshots for new screens and material visual changes. Include mobile and dark-theme states when relevant.
- Explain new reusable patterns or dependencies in the pull request.
- Follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the contribution workflow.
